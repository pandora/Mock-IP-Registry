An application needs to manage an internal registry of IP addresses and hostnames. Each hostname may have several associated IP addresses (and always at least one).
Each IP address may only be associated with one hostname.

For example:

www.example.com has IP addresses 10.1.1.1, 10.1.2.1, 10.1.3.1

mail.example.com has IP addresses 10.1.1.2, 10.1.1.3, 10.1.1.4

Hence IP address 10.1.1.1 has hostname 'www.example.com' and IP address 10.1.1.2 has hostname 'mail.example.com'

Design and implement an OO perl api to manage this data in memory (i.e. a hostname/ipaddress registry).

Your code should allow the application to:

- register a new hostname with it's ip address(es)

- get the ip address(es) for a hostname
- get the hostname for a IP address
- modify the list of ip addresses a hostname

- list all hostnames
- list all ip addresses

[If too easy, add this as well:
- save the registry to disk (in any format you choose)
- load the registry from disk]
